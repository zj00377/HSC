# Stochastic-Coordinate-Coding

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent. The dictionary is efficiently updated via stochastic gradient descent. Only the support of the dictionary is updated.

2. Coordinate Decent. The sparse code is first updated via one step of coordinate descent. Then only the nonzero entries of the sparse code are updated.

3. Adaptive Learning Rate. Each coordinate of the sparse code has its own learning rate. The learning rates are updated adaptively.
